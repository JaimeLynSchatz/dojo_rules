Hi, my name is Jaime. I am an edupunk studying programming. I love code!

My favorite track on CodeSchool (so far) has been the Electives! It's been so helpful in upping my Git game! :D

My deadly skills include 
*Ruby 
*JavaScript
*CSS
*HTML
*a touch of Python

I know just enough C to be truly lethal. ;)
